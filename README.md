# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
: start the program
### Step 2: 
get the input value as l1,l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the required output
### Step 5: 
end of the program
### PROGRAM:

import math
d1=[4,2]
d2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((d2[0]-d1[0])**2+(d2[1]-d1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
  ```

### OUTPUT:
![output]![distance](https://github.com/Thamizhjo/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/123891476/3039d751-b5ba-4904-bc52-dd253a37d4a3)
